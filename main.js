🎄 🎁 Help Save Christmas 🎁 🎄 

The north pole is in a bit of a mess and Santa🎅 needs your help with making sure the elves🧝 are matcheed up with their reindeer to gather all your Christmas gifts for ready for Christmas day 

Unfortunately, sometimes the elves have been off sick due a nasty bug going around.
At the start of the day Santa needs to know if a 'Substitute Elf' is needed to replace a sick elf. 

Your task:

You will get two array inputs. 
   > First Input: an array containing Santa's 9 reindeers 
   reindeers = ["Dasher", 
   "Dancer", 
   "Prancer", 
   "Vixen", 
   "Comet", 
   "Cupid", 
   "Donner", 
   "Blitzen", 
   "Rudolph" ]

   > Second Input: an array of objects containing Santa's elves and their assigned reindeer. NOTE: some of the elves might be off sick so may not be on the rota.
   elves = [ {Elf: "Dobby", Reindeer: "Dasher"},
      {Elf: "Daenys", Reindeer: "Dancer"},
      {Elf: "Plum", Reindeer: "Prancer"},
      {Elf: "Vaegon", Reindeer: "Vixen"},
      {Elf: "Candycane", Reindeer: "Comet"},
      {Elf: "Chestnut", Reindeer: "Cupid"},
      {Elf: "Doodles", Reindeer: "Donner"},
      {Elf: "Buddy", Reindeer: "Blitzen"},
      {Elf: "Ralphy", Reindeer: "Rudolph"}]
      
Your task is to:

1. match up each reindeer with its assigned elf, remember if an elf is off sick (i.e not in the list) to assign the reindeer a "Substitute Elf"

2. remember to make sure Rudolf with his luminous red nose is leading the reindeer team guiding Santa's sleigh on Christmas Eve

3. order the remaining reindeer alphabetically 

4. Return the coupled up elf and reindeer in an arrays ["reindeer", "elf"] within an array

Remember Santa🎅 runs a tight sleigh!
