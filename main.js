Help Save Christmas 

The north pole is in a bit of a mess and Santa needs your help with making sure the elves are matcheed up with their reindeer to gather all your Christmas gifts for Santa sleigh.

Your task:

You will get two array inputs. 
   > First Input: an array of Santa's 9 reindeers 
   reindeers = ["Dasher", "Dancer", "Prancer", "Vixen", "Comet", "Cupid", "Donner", "Blitzen", "Rudolph" ]
   > Second Input: an array containing Santa's elves
   elves = ["Dobby", "Daenys", "Plum", "Vaegon", "Candycane", "Chestnut", "Doodles", "Buddy", "Ralphy" ]

Match up each elf with its reindeer alphabetically.

Return the coupled up elves and reindeers in an array of arrays. 

> additional step - put rudolph as the pack leader
> sub elf (undefined)

expected = 
[
   ["Blitzen" ,"Buddy"],
   ["Comet","Candycane"],
   ["Cupid","Chestnut"],
   ["Dancer","Daenys"],
   ["Dasher", "Dobby"],
   ["Donner" ,"Doodles"],
